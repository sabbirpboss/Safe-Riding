# SAFE RIDING  

## Live site link [SAFE RIDING](https://safe-riding-a09.netlify.app/).

* installed react 18 version and created an awesome bike review website
* using react router DOM
* created Link by using react router "Routes"
* use charts from recharts.org

note: At first I am installed react bootstrap for using Bootstrap. But then I am confused to use that. So, finally I have used vanilla css, but I could not remove those installed bootstrap package yet. And also I never try to remove that bootstrap package because I was being afraid what if my project was crushed.
